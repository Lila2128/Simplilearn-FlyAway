# Simplilearn-FlyAway

<h2>FlyAway is a ticket-booking portal that lets people book flights on their website</h2>
<h3>Project Details:</h3>

This project aims to design and develop an airline booking portal named as FlyAway using Java EE technologies. 
I developed it as a project of phase 2 for the Become a back-end expert course. The goal of this project is to apply servlet, jsp and JDBC concepts.

<h3> Website Features </h3>
● A search form in the homepage to allow entry of travel details, like the date of travel, source, destination, and the number of persons.<br>
● Based on the travel details entered, it will show the available flights with their ticket prices.<br>
● Once a person selects a flight to book, they will be taken to a register page where they must fill in their personal details. 
In the next page, they are shown the flight details of the flight that they are booking, and the payment is done via a dummy payment gateway. 
On completion of the payment, they are shown a confirmation page with the details of the booking.   

<h3>Product Backlog:</h3>
Create database and tables.
Connect the database to the project.
Create models classes.
Create a database utility class to retrieve data.
Create login pages for user and admin separately.
Create JSP files for all pages of the project.
Create a servlet to get requests and send responses to the JSP files.
Debug and Test the project.

<h3>Technologies and tools Used:</h3>
• Servlet: to do the business logic and works a controller for the project.

• JSP: to handle the presentation view.

• SQL: to create and manage the database.

• JDBC: to make operations on the database for the project.

• Eclipse: to write and run the code.

• Tomcat: to run and deploy servlet application.


<h3>Core concepts used in the project:</h3>
• Object-Oriented: used to create and model objects for users and their credentials.

• Databases: used to store and retrieve data.

• Data Sources: used to define a set of properties required to identify and access the database.

• Collections: used some collections such arraylist to store collection of data.

• Exception Handling: used to catch problems that arises in the code especially in I/O blocks.

<h3>How to run the program:</h3>
• clone project and create a dynamic web project

• Add the “mysql-connector-java-8.0.28.jar” file to the lib folder inside your project's WEB-INF folder.

• Go to “\src\main\java\DbConnect\DbUtil.java" file and open it.

• Edit the database’ properties such as username, password and driverClassName to be suit to your database administration tool.

• Now run program on a server.

• To login you must enter admin for both username and password.
